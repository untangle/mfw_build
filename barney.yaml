    # Firewall build, so hopefully new versions will be backwards
    # compatible.  This image was pushed to docker.corp by John

      # The standard docker image runs /home/mfw/tools/build.sh by default.
      # We don't want to do that in all cases, so override that here.
      # Ideally, we'd override init to be "", but this doesn't work, because
      # "" is equivalent to no override, so override to /usr/bin/env, which
      # does nothing by default (e.g., exec["/usr/bin/env", "foo", "bar"] is
      # almost the same as exec["foo", "bar"]).
